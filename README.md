I need help in coding I want to learn python 
I came across this topic "Dictionary" Can anyone explain?
==>Dictionary in Python
Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized.
Note – Keys in a dictionary doesn’t allows Polymorphism.
Creating Dictionary in Python;
In Python, a Dictionary can be created by placing sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by ‘comma’. Dictionary holds a pair of values, one being the Key and the other corresponding pair element being its Key:value. Values in a dictionary can be of any datatype and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable.
Note – Dictionary keys are case sensitive, same name but different cases of Key will be treated distinctly.
